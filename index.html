                <p>I used to think that a "startup" was just about writing code. Then, in 2025, I went to Italian Tech
                    Week. I met some of the biggest founders and investors in Italy. I realized that big companies are
                    just made by normal people who refuse to give up.</p>
                <p>That changed how I see myself. I am a student in High School, but I am also
                    a builder. I love mixing technology (like AI and Robotics) with human things (like people and art).
                </p>
                <p>I believe in "High Agency." This means that if I don't know how to do something, I just learn it. If
                    the tool I need doesn't exist, I build it myself.</p>
                <p>I am always looking for the next challenge. If you want to build something together, or if you just
                    want to say hi, let's talk.</p>

                <p>I love art, but I noticed a problem. Museums can be expensive, and not everyone lives near a big
                    city. I wanted to fix this.</p>
                <p>I built an app called AR-T for the Meta Quest 3. It uses Augmented Reality to put famous paintings
                    right in your living room. It even has a voice assistant to teach you about the history of the art.
                </p>
                <p>It was a test to see if I could use new technology to solve an old problem. It worked! Over 748
                    people have downloaded it. It makes me happy to know that hundreds of people are enjoying culture
                    for free because of something I wrote.</p>

                <p>When I took my SAT, I studied hard and got a 1440. This put me in the top 5% of students. I was
                    happy, but I knew that many students don't have the money for expensive tutors.</p>
                <p>So, I joined Schoolhouse.world. It is a platform started by Sal Khan (from Khan Academy) where
                    students teach students.</p>
                <p>Now, I run a "Bootcamp" for Reading and Writing. I help people from all over the world improve their
                    English scores. When a student from another continent tells me they passed their exam because of my
                    help, it feels better than any grade I could get in school.</p>

                <p>Why is there a race car on my desk?</p>
                <p>In 2025, my siblings and I got an amazing gift. The President of the FIA gave us VIP tickets to the
                    Monza Grand Prix. We were right in the middle of the action.</p>
                <p>I didn't just watch the race. I watched the people. The service was perfect. They knew what I wanted
                    before I even asked. I realized that this is what "True Hospitality" means.</p>
                <p>I am using this lesson right now. I am building a robot for events (see the Robot section!). I don't
                    just want it to work; I want it to treat guests with that same perfect level of service I felt at
                    Monza.</p>
                <p>It wasn't just about the experience, it made me think about how something given for free could mean
                    so much for someone. The tickets were a gift, but the experience was priceless. That's why, when I
                    can, I give back to the world: you never know how much something you do for free could mean to
                    someone else.</p>
                <p>I also learned that the best moments in life are often unexpected. I never planned to go to the
                    paddock for a full day, but it became one of the most inspiring days of my life.</p>

                <p>This is my biggest project. I manage SuperNAO.</p>
                <p>We took a standard robot and made it do amazing things while chasing the limits of AI and
                    human-robot interactions.
                    We partnered with big names like La Sapienza
                    University and Nuvolari. We even won 1st Place at the Aster Cultura Awards.</p>
                <p>Right now, I am turning this knowledge into a real business product. I am writing custom code that
                    lets the robot work at business hospitalities. It can welcome guests, answer questions, and collect
                    data
                    for the organizers. It turns a fun robot into a serious tool for companies that promotes innovative
                    thinking while providing unique connections and data.</p>

                <p>I like building cool robots, but I also like business.</p>
                <p>I noticed that Real Estate agents waste a lot of time on the phone. They talk to people who don't
                    actually want to buy. So, I am building a tool to fix this.</p>
                <p>It is an AI assistant that lives on their website. It talks to customers, understands what they need,
                    and shows them the perfect house instantly. It saves time for the agent and helps the customer find
                    their dream home faster.</p>

                <p>I wanted to give him a gift. So, I built him a brand new portfolio from scratch.</p>
                <p>I treated him like my most important client. I spent hours making sure every pixel was perfect. It
                    taught me that if you are going to do something, you should do it with excellence, even if it is
                    just a favor for a friend.</p>

                <p>I don't just write code. I also write about the future of Europe.</p>
                <p>I am one of the editors for Europa 2028 - The European Magazine. You can buy it in big bookstores
                    like Feltrinelli and Mondadori.</p>
                <p>I write about the technology race between Europe, the USA, and China. I analyze things like Space
                    travel, AI, and Electric Vehicles. Because of this work, I was invited to speak on the radio, and I
                    even got to discuss policy with former Minister Tiziano Treu.</p>
                <p>It is important to me to understand how the world works, not just how computers work. This way I can
                    bend the rules and find the grey areas where startups as big as Uber excelled at.</p>

                <p>I put this bin here to be honest with you. Not everything I touch turns to gold. But if it ain't
                    gold, it is a lesson I will never forget.</p>
                <p>I once tried to launch an education startup called ms4a. I had a crazy idea to launch it in just 3
                    days before New Year's Eve. I stayed up all night writing scripts and filming videos. I got 1,500
                    views in 3 days on each social media (3k views total), but the startup didn't work out. It made me
                    understand the work required to market something massively on various social platforms and, at the
                    same time, it was the reason why I bought the ms4a.net domain which I am now using for all of my
                    projects.</p>
                <p>I also tried to make a Roblox game to fight gambling addiction. It was a progressive experience based
                    on a popular game in Italy but the concept was too complex to implement in Roblox. It was too hard
                    to
                    code, so I had to
                    stop.</p>
                <p>And finally... I applied to my dream college in the UK. I got in! But then, the funding failed, and I
                    couldn't go. I was crushed. But staying in Italy led me to the Magazine, the Robot project, and
                    everything you see here.</p>
                <p>As Steve Jobs said: "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking
                    backwards."</p>
                <p>If you are failing at something right now, don't worry. It's just part of the process.</p>
