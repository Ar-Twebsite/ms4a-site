The plan is the following:

Create inside this directory a series of folder each containing one daily lessons with this content.
Each page must be an amazing Duolingo-like class that, however, works with a static website.
You must use the colour scheme and design used in the homepage (index.html) and make sure all pages are accessible at domain/day1/ and domain/day2/ and so on.

Each page must be dynamic, interaction friendly, mobile and laptop optimized an must be as perfectly crafted as possible.

Title: Day 1: Money, Sin, and a Big Hole in the Roof
Progress Bar: [====....................] (Day 1/7)
📜 Part 1: The Context (The Bankers of God)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The History:
It is the year 1400. Forget Italy as a country; it doesn't exist yet. It is a collection of fighting city-states.
Rome is a ruin (literally cows grazing in the Forum). But Florence is different. Florence is becoming the engine of Europe. Why? Wool and Money.
The Power Shift:
A new family is rising: The Medici.
They aren't royalty. They are bankers. In the Middle Ages, banking was a sin called "Usury" (making money from money). According to the Church, if you charged interest, you went to Hell.
The Medici found a loophole: "We aren't charging interest; we are taking a 'commission' for currency exchange."
They became the richest family in Europe. But they had a problem: Guilt. They were terrified of eternal damnation.
The Solution:
To buy their way into Heaven, they started pouring millions into the Church and into Art. The Renaissance didn't start because everyone suddenly got creative; it started because rich bankers needed to clean their conscience.
Checkpoint Question:
Why was the Renaissance funded mostly by bankers?
A) They loved pretty colors.
B) To atone for the sin of Usury (Charging interest). ✅
C) The King forced them to.
🗣️ Part 2: The Drama (The Egg & The Rivalry)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The Scandal:
Florence had a massive cathedral, but it had no roof. For decades, rain rained right onto the altar. It was a humiliation. The hole was too big (150 feet wide), and no one knew how to build a dome that wouldn't collapse under its own weight.
The Contest (1418):
The city held a competition. Two men entered:
Lorenzo Ghiberti: The famous, polished, well-dressed golden boy.
Filippo Brunelleschi: Short, bald, dirty, and known for having a terrible temper.
The "Egg" Moment:
The judges asked Brunelleschi to show his plans. He refused, fearing Ghiberti would steal them. Instead, he challenged them: "Whoever can make an egg stand upright on the marble table gets the commission."
Everyone tried and failed. The egg kept rolling over.
Brunelleschi took the egg, smashed the bottom on the table, and it stood upright.
The judges yelled, "We could have done that!"
Brunelleschi replied, "You could have built the dome, too, had you known how."
He got the job. But the city forced him to work with his rival, Ghiberti. Brunelleschi hated this so much he faked being sick for weeks just to prove Ghiberti couldn't do the math without him.
🎨 Part 3: The Masterpiece (The Duomo)
Reading Time: 10 Minutes
The Work: The Dome of Santa Maria del Fiore
The Artist: Filippo Brunelleschi
Visual Decoding:
Look at the Dome. It isn't a circle; it's an octagon.
Brunelleschi solved the physics problem by building two domes:
An inner shell (thick) to hold the weight.
An outer shell (thin) to protect against wind and rain.
In between them, there are stairs. He literally built a dome inside a dome.
The Innovation:
He invented a "Herringbone" brick pattern (zigzag). If you lay bricks horizontally, they fall in. If you lock them vertically (zigzag), gravity holds them in place while the mortar dries.
He built the largest masonry dome in the world without any scaffolding. It is still the largest brick dome on earth today.
Your "Cocktail Party" Fact:
Brunelleschi didn't just build the dome; he invented the machines to build it. He created the world's first reverse-gear hoist (using oxen) so they didn't have to unhitch the animals to bring the load down. He also invented a cafeteria on the roof so workers wouldn't waste time walking down for lunch. He was the Elon Musk of 1420.
⚔️ The Day 1 Challenge (Active Recall)
If you pass this, you unlock Day 2.
The Motivation:
Why did the Medici spend so much money on art?
[ ] To impress the French.
[ ] To clean their souls from the sin of banking. (Correct)
[ ] To sell tickets to tourists.
The Physics:
What pattern of bricks did Brunelleschi use to stop the dome from falling?
[ ] Stacked
[ ] Herringbone (Zigzag) (Correct)
[ ] Circular
The Identity:
The Renaissance shifted focus from "God centered" to...
[ ] "Human centered" (Humanism) (Correct)
[ ] "Money centered"
[ ] "Nature centered"
Reflection:
Today, you learned that beauty often comes from guilt (Medici) and spite (Brunelleschi). Tomorrow, we look at the man who burned his own paintings.


🏛️ DAY 2: FULL LESSON CONTENT
Title: Day 2: The Bonfire of the Vanities
Progress Bar: [======..............] (Day 2/7)
📜 Part 1: The Context (The Party is Over)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The History:
Yesterday, under the Medici, Florence was a 24/7 party of philosophy and art. But parties end.
By the late 1490s, the bank was losing money, and the people were hungry. When people are hungry, they get radical.
The Power Shift:
Enter Girolamo Savonarola. He wasn't a banker; he was a fanatical monk.
He looked at the art, the makeup, and the poetry, and he didn't see beauty. He saw corruption. He preached that the Medici were leading Florence to Hell.
His sermons were terrifying. When the French army invaded (by coincidence), the people believed Savonarola was a prophet. They kicked the Medici out. Florence went from a carnival to a monastery overnight.
🗣️ Part 2: The Drama (Burning the Art)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The Scandal:
Savonarola organized the "Bonfire of the Vanities" (1497).
He sent boys door-to-door to collect "vanities."
What is a vanity? Mirrors, cosmetics, fancy clothes, musical instruments, and art.
They built a pyramid in the city square, 60 feet high, and set it on fire.
The Tragedy:
Sandro Botticelli, the sensitive artist who painted the famous Birth of Venus, fell under Savonarola’s spell.
Botticelli was terrified for his soul. According to biography, Botticelli himself threw some of his own paintings onto the fire. The "Golden Age" was burned to ash by the very people who created it.
🎨 Part 3: The Masterpiece (The Survivor)
Reading Time: 10 Minutes
The Work: The Birth of Venus
The Artist: Sandro Botticelli
Visual Decoding:
This painting survived the fire.
Look at Venus (the center). She is floating on a shell. She is nude.
This was shocking. For 1,000 years, the only female nude allowed in art was Eve (shameful). Botticelli made nudity divine again.
She isn't standing correctly (she has no weight); she looks like she is cut out of paper. This wasn't a mistake—it was a style choice to show she belonged to a spiritual world, not the physical one.
Your "Cocktail Party" Fact:
Savonarola eventually went too far. He annoyed the Pope. The Pope excommunicated him. The people of Florence turned on the monk, and a year after the Bonfire, they burned Savonarola in the exact same spot he burned the art.
⚔️ The Day 2 Challenge (Active Recall)
The Villain: Who convinced Florence to burn their art?

Lorenzo de Medici

Girolamo Savonarola (Correct)

The Pope
The Shift: Why was The Birth of Venus controversial?

It was the first non-Biblical female nude since antiquity. (Correct)

It was painted in oil.

It depicted the Virgin Mary.
The Fate: What happened to the monk Savonarola?

He became Pope.

He was burned at the stake. (Correct)

He fled to France.

🏛️ DAY 3: FULL LESSON CONTENT
Title: Day 3: The Failed Experiment
Progress Bar: [=========...........] (Day 3/7)
📜 Part 1: The Context (The Resume)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The History:
Leonardo da Vinci is 30 years old. He is talented, but he has a reputation: He never finishes anything. He leaves Florence for Milan to find a new patron, Duke Ludovico Sforza.
The Power Shift:
Leonardo writes the famous "Sforza Resume." He lists 10 skills to get the job.
Number 1-9 are about war: "I can build bridges," "I can divert rivers," "I can make armored tanks."
Only at number 10 does he add: "Also, I can paint."
The Duke hired him. Not as a painter, but as a military engineer and party planner.
🗣️ Part 2: The Drama (The Peeling Wall)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The Scandal:
The Duke asked Leonardo to paint the dining hall of a monastery.
Normal "Fresco" painting (painting on wet plaster) requires speed. You have to finish before the plaster dries.
Leonardo hated speed. He wanted to think, stare, and layer.
The Failure:
So, Leonardo invented a new mix of oil and tempera to paint on dry wall. It allowed him to take his time.
It was a disaster. The paint didn't bond. Within 20 years, the greatest painting in the world began to flake off the wall. Today, only about 20% of the original paint remains. It is a masterpiece that is slowly dying.
🎨 Part 3: The Masterpiece (The Betrayal)
Reading Time: 10 Minutes
The Work: The Last Supper
The Artist: Leonardo da Vinci
Visual Decoding:
This isn't a dinner party; it is an explosion.
Leonardo captured the specific second after Jesus said: "One of you will betray me."
Look at the reaction of the disciples. They are grouped in threes. They are terrified.
Jesus forms a calm triangle in the chaos.
Your "Cocktail Party" Fact:
The prior of the monastery complained that Leonardo was working too slowly. Leonardo told the Duke: "I am searching for a face evil enough to model for Judas. If I can’t find one, I will use the face of the prior." The prior stopped complaining.
⚔️ The Day 3 Challenge (Active Recall)
The Job: What did Leonardo primarily pitch himself as to the Duke?

A Painter

A Military Engineer (Correct)

A Chef
The Technique: Why is The Last Supper in such bad condition today?

It was bombed in WWII.

Leonardo experimented with paint on dry wall. (Correct)

Monks threw food at it.
The Moment: What moment does the painting depict?

The Eucharist.

The announcement of betrayal. (Correct)

The resurrection.

🏛️ DAY 4: FULL LESSON CONTENT
Title: Day 4: The Giant in the Stone
Progress Bar: [============........] (Day 4/7)
📜 Part 1: The Context (The Trash Marble)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The History:
The Medici were kicked out. Florence was a Republic again. But they were surrounded by enemies (The Pope, The French, The Medici trying to return).
The city government wanted a statue to represent their strength. They needed a symbol of a "small guy defeating a giant." They needed David.
The Problem:
They had no money for marble.
There was a massive block in the cathedral yard called "The Giant." Two other sculptors had tried to carve it years ago and failed, gouging a hole in the middle. It had been sitting in the rain for 40 years. It was considered garbage.
🗣️ Part 2: The Drama (The Rivalry)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The Scandal:
Leonardo da Vinci was consulted, but said the stone was unusable.
A 26-year-old Michelangelo stepped up. He said, "I can do it."
He built a shed around the block so no one could see him work. He barely ate. He slept in his boots. He worked with a fury called terribilità.
When he revealed it, the city was stunned. Leonardo suggested hiding it in a dark corner (out of jealousy). The city ignored him and put it right in front of the government palace.
🎨 Part 3: The Masterpiece (The Watcher)
Reading Time: 10 Minutes
The Work: The David
The Artist: Michelangelo
Visual Decoding:
Most Davids show him after killing Goliath (holding the head).
Michelangelo shows him before.
Look at his eyes. He is glaring into the distance. He is terrified but focused.
Look at his right hand. It is too big. This is intentional—David was known as "manu fortis" (strong of hand).
Your "Cocktail Party" Fact:
The pupils of David’s eyes are carved in the shape of hearts (actually indented drills) to catch the light so they look intense from the ground. Also, because the block was previously ruined, the statue is extremely thin from side-to-side.
⚔️ The Day 4 Challenge (Active Recall)
The Material: Why was the block of marble controversial?

It was too expensive.

It had been ruined by previous sculptors. (Correct)

It was pink.
The Timing: When in the story is this David depicted?

Before the fight. (Correct)

During the fight.

After the fight.
The Rival: Who suggested hiding the statue?

Raphael

Leonardo da Vinci (Correct)

The Pope

🏛️ DAY 5: FULL LESSON CONTENT
Title: Day 5: The Ceiling of Hell
Progress Bar: [===============.....] (Day 5/7)
📜 Part 1: The Context (The Warrior Pope)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The History:
Rome is back. The new Pope is Julius II. He doesn't pray much; he leads armies. He wants to rebuild Rome to be greater than the ancient Empire.
The Power Shift:
Julius forces Michelangelo to come to Rome. Michelangelo wants to carve the Pope's tomb (a massive project).
The Pope changes his mind. "Paint the ceiling of my chapel instead."
Michelangelo says no. "I am a sculptor, not a painter."
The Pope says: "Do it or go to jail."
🗣️ Part 2: The Drama (The Agony)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The Scandal:
Michelangelo hated every minute of it. He fired all his assistants because they weren't good enough. He locked the doors.
He did NOT lie on his back. He stood up, head tilted back, for 4 years.
Paint dripped into his eyes. His back grew curved. He wrote a poem about how his "brush was dripping on his face" and his "intestines were crushed."
He constantly fought with the Pope. The Pope hit him with a cane once. Michelangelo threatened to leave. It was a toxic relationship that created beauty.
🎨 Part 3: The Masterpiece (The Spark)
Reading Time: 10 Minutes
The Work: The Creation of Adam (Sistine Chapel Ceiling)
The Artist: Michelangelo
Visual Decoding:
Focus on the hands. God is rushing in (hair blowing). Adam is lazy, limp on the earth.
The fingers do not touch.
That inch of space is the most important space in art history. It represents the "spark" of life passing from divine to human. If they touched, it would just be a handshake. The gap creates the tension.
Your "Cocktail Party" Fact:
Michelangelo painted God’s brain in the shape of... a human brain. If you outline the cloud around God, it perfectly matches the anatomical cross-section of a human brain. Was he saying God is a product of the human mind?
⚔️ The Day 5 Challenge (Active Recall)
The Profession: What was Michelangelo's main excuse for refusing the job?

"I am too expensive."

"I am a sculptor, not a painter." (Correct)

"I am sick."
The Myth: How did he paint the ceiling?

Lying on his back.

Standing with head tilted back. (Correct)

Hanging from a rope.
The Detail: What is significant about the fingers of God and Adam?

They are holding hands.

They do not touch. (Correct)

Adam is pushing God away.

🏛️ DAY 6: FULL LESSON CONTENT
Title: Day 6: The Golden Boy
Progress Bar: [==================..] (Day 6/7)
📜 Part 1: The Context (The New Kid)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The History:
While Michelangelo was grumping around in the Sistine Chapel, a young, handsome, charming guy arrived in Rome.
Raphael Sanzio.
The Power Shift:
Everyone loved Raphael. He was polite, he dressed well, and he was fast. The Pope loved him.
While Michelangelo was painting the ceiling, the Pope hired Raphael to paint his private library (The Stanza della Segnatura) right down the hall.
🗣️ Part 2: The Drama (The Sneak Peek)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The Scandal:
Michelangelo wouldn't let anyone see the ceiling. But he went out of town for a few days.
The architect Bramante (who had the keys) let Raphael sneak in.
Raphael looked up and was stunned by the massive figures Michelangelo was painting.
The Tribute:
Raphael went back to his own wall and added a figure. He painted Heraclitus—a grumpy philosopher sitting alone, wearing stone-mason boots, brooding over a block of marble.
It is a portrait of Michelangelo. It was Raphael's way of saying, "I see you, and I respect you."
🎨 Part 3: The Masterpiece (The Party of Minds)
Reading Time: 10 Minutes
The Work: The School of Athens
The Artist: Raphael
Visual Decoding:
This painting represents "Philosophy." It brings together all the great thinkers of history into one room.
The Center:
Plato (left) points UP (to the ideal world/heaven). He looks like Leonardo da Vinci.
Aristotle (right) points DOWN (to the earth/science).
Your "Cocktail Party" Fact:
Raphael painted himself in the corner. On the far right, there is a young man looking directly at you. That’s him. Breaking the fourth wall.
⚔️ The Day 6 Challenge (Active Recall)
The Personality: How was Raphael different from Michelangelo?

He was charming and social. (Correct)

He was older.

He was a better sculptor.
The Tribute: Who is the brooding figure sitting on the steps?

Plato

Michelangelo (as Heraclitus). (Correct)

The Pope
The Center: Why does Plato point up?

He is looking at the birds.

He focuses on the spiritual/ideal realm. (Correct)

He is asking a question.

🏛️ DAY 7: FULL LESSON CONTENT
Title: Day 7: The End of the World
Progress Bar: [====================] (Day 7/7)
📜 Part 1: The Context (The Crash)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The History:
It is 1527. The High Renaissance is dead.
Why? Because foreign armies (The Holy Roman Empire) sacked Rome. They looted the city, killed priests, and stabled horses in the Vatican.
The optimism is gone. The Church is under attack by Martin Luther and the Protestants.
The Power Shift:
Art changes. It stops being perfect and pretty. It becomes twisted, dark, and chaotic. This style is called "Mannerism."
🗣️ Part 2: The Drama (The Revenge)
Reading Time: 5 Minutes
The Scandal:
Michelangelo is called back to the Sistine Chapel 25 years after he finished the ceiling. He is an old man now. The Pope asks him to paint the wall behind the altar.
He paints The Last Judgment. It is terrifying. Everyone is naked and muscular.
The Pope’s Master of Ceremonies, Biagio da Cesena, complained: "This is a bathroom scene, not a chapel."
The Burn:
Michelangelo painted Biagio into Hell (bottom right corner). He gave him donkey ears (for being an ass) and had a snake biting his genitals.
Biagio complained to the Pope. The Pope laughed and said: "I have authority in Earth and Heaven, but I have no jurisdiction in Hell. You stay there."
🎨 Part 3: The Masterpiece (The Flayed Man)
Reading Time: 10 Minutes
The Work: The Last Judgment
The Artist: Michelangelo
Visual Decoding:
Look at Jesus in the center. He isn't the skinny, suffering Jesus. He is massive, like a bodybuilder. He looks angry. He is smiting the damned.
The Self-Portrait:
Look at Saint Bartholomew (to the right of Jesus). He was martyred by being skinned alive, so he holds his own skin.
Look closely at the face on the limp skin.
It is a self-portrait of Michelangelo.
He felt flayed by the church, by his art, and by his life. It is the saddest selfie in history.
⚔️ The Day 7 Challenge (Active Recall)
The Event: What historical event ended the High Renaissance?

The discovery of America.

The Sack of Rome (1527). (Correct)

The death of the Pope.
The Revenge: Where did Michelangelo put his critic, Biagio?

In Heaven.

In Hell, with donkey ears. (Correct)

Behind a tree.
The Selfie: Where is Michelangelo's self-portrait?

On the face of Jesus.

On the flayed skin of St. Bartholomew. (Correct)

He is not in the painting.
