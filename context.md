Here is the narrative text for each pop-up.

1. The Laptop (My Story & Contact)

Title: The Full Picture

I used to think that a "startup" was just about writing code. Then, in 2025, I went to Italian Tech Week. I met some of the biggest founders and investors in Italy. I realized that big companies are just made by normal people who refuse to give up.

That changed how I see myself. I am a student at the Cambridge Scientific High School, but I am also a builder. I love mixing technology (like AI and Robotics) with human things (like policy and art).

I believe in "High Agency." This means that if I don't know how to do something, I just learn it. If the tool I need doesn't exist, I build it myself.

I am always looking for the next challenge. If you want to build something together, or if you just want to say hi, let's talk.

2. The VR Headset (AR-T)

Title: Bringing Art to Everyone

I love art, but I noticed a problem. Museums can be expensive, and not everyone lives near a big city. I wanted to fix this.

I built an app called AR-T for the Meta Quest 3. It uses Augmented Reality to put famous paintings right in your living room. It even has a voice assistant to teach you about the history of the art.

It was a test to see if I could use new technology to solve an old problem. It worked! Over 748 people have downloaded it. It makes me happy to know that hundreds of people are enjoying culture for free because of something I wrote.

3. The Globe (Schoolhouse.world)

Title: Helping the World Learn

When I took my SATs, I studied hard and got a 1440. This put me in the top 5% of students. I was happy, but I knew that many students don't have the money for expensive tutors.

So, I joined Schoolhouse.world. It is a platform started by Sal Khan (from Khan Academy) where students teach students.

Now, I run a "Bootcamp" for Reading and Writing. I help people from all over the world improve their English scores. When a student from another continent tells me they passed their exam because of my help, it feels better than any grade I could get in school.

4. The F1 Car (Hospitality)

Title: What I Learned at Monza

Why is there a race car on my desk?

In 2025, my siblings and I got an amazing gift. The President of the FIA gave us VIP tickets to the Monza Grand Prix. We were right in the middle of the action.

I didn't just watch the race. I watched the people. The service was perfect. They knew what I wanted before I even asked. I realized that this is what "True Hospitality" means.

I am using this lesson right now. I am building a robot for events (see the Robot section!). I don't just want it to work; I want it to treat guests with that same perfect level of service I felt at Monza.

5. The Robot (NAO)

Title: Not Just a Toy

This is my biggest project. I manage SuperNAO.

We took a standard robot and made it do amazing things. We partnered with big names like La Sapienza University and Nuvolari. We even won 1st Place at the Aster Cultura Awards.

Right now, I am turning this knowledge into a real business product. I am writing custom AI code that lets the robot work at business events. It can welcome guests, answer questions, and collect data for the organizers. It turns a fun robot into a serious tool for companies.

6. The Small House (Real Estate AI)

Title: Solving Boring Problems

I like building cool robots, but I also like business.

I noticed that Real Estate agents waste a lot of time on the phone. They talk to people who don't actually want to buy. So, I am building a tool to fix this.

It is an AI assistant that lives on their website. It talks to customers, understands what they need, and shows them the perfect house instantly. It saves time for the agent and helps the customer find their dream home faster.

7. The Camera (Friendship)

Title: Digital Craftsmanship

I have a friend who is an incredible photographer. He does shoots all over the world. But when I looked at his website, it didn't look good. It didn't match his talent.

I wanted to give him a gift. So, I built him a brand new portfolio from scratch.

I treated him like my most important client. I spent hours making sure every pixel was perfect. It taught me that if you are going to do something, you should do it with excellence, even if it is just a favor for a friend.

8. The Books (The Magazine)

Title: Writing the Future

I don't just write code. I also write about the future of Europe.

I am one of the editors for Europa 2028 - The European Magazine. You can buy it in big bookstores like Feltrinelli and Mondadori.

I write about the technology race between Europe, the USA, and China. I analyze things like Space travel, AI, and Electric Vehicles. Because of this work, I was invited to speak on the radio, and I even got to discuss policy with former Minister Tiziano Treu.

It is important to me to understand how the world works, not just how computers work.

9. The Bin (My Failures)

Title: The Graveyard of Ideas

I put this bin here to be honest with you. Not everything I touch turns to gold.

I once tried to launch an education startup called ms4a. I had a crazy idea to launch it in just 3 days before New Year's Eve. I stayed up all night writing scripts and filming videos. I got 1,500 views in 3 days on each social media (3k views total), but the startup didn't work out.

I also tried to make a Roblox game to fight gambling addiction. It was too hard to code, so I had to stop.

And finally... I applied to my dream college in the UK. I got in! But then, the funding failed, and I couldn't go. I was crushed. But staying in Italy led me to the Magazine, the Robot project, and everything you see here.

As Steve Jobs said: "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards."

If you are failing at something right now, don't worry. It's just part of the process.



more context:
1) this is the calendly embed: <!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->
<div class="calendly-inline-widget" data-url="https://calendly.com/filippo-labate/chat" style="min-width:320px;height:700px;"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js" async></script>
<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->

2) this is the AR App -> https://sidequestvr.com/app/37779/ar-t-experience-art-in-augmented-reality download page and this is the AR app website: https://ar-t.ms4a.net/

3) this is the bootcamp: https://schoolhouse.world/series/72292?ref=share-button

4) add fucntionality to the button to open image for the monza section. I need it to be integrated in the style of the website. 

5) On the gamboy version, it takes only the first word of some stuff so it looks weird. Fix it because the context matters. You can abbreviate given the context but it can't just be cut as it is now.

6) remvoe the learn more button at the end of the solving boring problems

7) this is my friend's photography portfolio: https://www.ms4a.net/chertiphotographer/

8) add, instead of the read magazine button, a button that shows some immages with the same logic as the Monza thing.

9) there is nothing to read more about in the graweyard of ideas so please remove the read more button. 

10) improve the styling of the pop up window text so that it looks better and more structured. 

11) now that you know more about each project, change the sentece shown as the page loads at the start.

12) implement all dynamic loading for the images in the pop up windows and make sure that the images are shown in a nice way. 

13) work on the SEO of the website so that it ranks for "Filippo Labate" and "Filippo Labate Portfolio" but also for keywords in each of the projects domain
