Given the current scene, I need you to add these 2 elements:

1) Icon: clapperboard.webp
TITLE: Visualizing Democracy: "Ciak Europa"
SUBTITLE: 3rd Place Winner - European Commission Representation in Italy
THE BRIEF:
How do you make the European Elections relevant to Gen Z?
THE EXECUTION:
Written, directed, and edited a short film exploring the weight of a single vote. Selected by a jury of industry professionals as one of the top 3 works nationwide.
THE TAKEAWAY:
Policy is useless if you can't communicate it. This was an exercise in translating complex civic duty into visual emotion.

if you could embed the shortfilm in some way: https://youtu.be/H9na8u_JLGc?si=-vUHbQ0von7h4mpM or add a button that redirects to it

This is mostly the copy that you need to add: HEADER
